    <p>Here is how you tear up railroad track. “ The jaw of a giant loader plucked
    up railroad ties in its teeth. A wheelbarrow-like contraption sucked up bolts
    and spikes, and spit them out. Guys in hardhats snipped off power cables and
    yanked down wire fences. ” 1
     Stripped for metal during World War II, railroads
    are now stripped for tax reasons. Gradually, thousands of miles of track have
    been abandoned since peaking at 254,000 miles in 1916; 2
     the pace has only speed up since deregulation in 1980. In photographer Mark Ruwedel ’ s Central
    Pacific #18 (1994), you can see the track bed exposed and eroding ( figure 1.1 ).
    A pile of bent trestles along the side disrupts the symmetry of the composition.
    The familiar parallel lines of a railroad track heading to the vanishing
    point seem to signal another vanishing: the railroad, that technology of the
    machine age, itself heading for obsolescence.</p>
    <p>But the relatively recent gouges and tire marks in Ruwedel ’ s photograph
    suggest that the railroad has not been swept aside entirely by new technologies.
    In fact, the relationship between old and new is a complicated one,
    because beneath the abandoned railroad bed from the nineteenth century
    lies fiber-optic cable, technology of the twenty-first century. In 1978, the
    track ’ s owner, the Southern Pacific Railroad, realized that it could sell excess
    capacity on its network — heretofore used for internal communications, such
    as train signaling — to corporate customers. A few years later, the Southern
    Pacific spun off this telecommunications division, the Southern Pacific Railroad
    Internal Network; its new acronym was SPRINT. Around ten years later,
    it spun off a second company, Southern Pacific Telecommunications Company,
    later renamed Qwest, to run fiber beneath its rights-of-way.</p>
